                <p>pet isany animal kept by human beings as a source of companionship and pleasure.

                 While a pet is generally kept for the pleasure that it can give to its owner, often, especially with horses, dogs, and cats, as well as with some other domesticated animals, this pleasure appears to be mutual. Thus, pet keeping can be described as a symbiotic relationship, one that benefits both animals and human beings</p>
                 <p> As the keeping of pets has been practiced from prehistoric times to the present and as pets are found in nearly every culture and society</p>
